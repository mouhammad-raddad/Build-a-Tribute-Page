            Dean Winchester (b. January 24, 1979 â€“ d. 2025) was a human and
            hunter as well as a member of the Men of Letters with his younger
            brother Sam. He and his brother are members of the Winchester[4] and
            Campbell families.[5] Through his father, Dean is the older
            half-brother of Adam Milligan.

            Dean is also the destined vessel of the Archangel Michael.[7] He and
            Sam are also the surrogate sons of the late Bobby Singer.[8][9] Dean
            is best friends with the angel Castiel, close friend to the late
            prophet Kevin Tran, and reluctant ally of Crowley. Dean has an
            ex-girlfriend, Lisa Braeden,[10] who he lived with for a year[11]
            when he thought Sam was in Hell. She has a child named Ben, who Dean
            acted as a father for during that year. Dean's biological child was
            an amazon named Emma.[12] He is also the former apprentice of
            Alastair.

            Both Dean and Sam were raised in the hunting life by their father,
            after the demon Azazel killed their mother. Dean's main role in the
            series is being the self-appointed guardian of Sam and often going
            to extreme lengths to protect him regardless of personal cost. Often
            in these occurrences Dean finds himself the center of a much larger
            picture.

            When he was killed by Metatron whilst using the Mark of Cain, Dean
            returned as a demon and a Knight of Hell loyal only to himself. He
            was then cured by his brother using purified blood. Eventually, the
            Mark was removed, but the price was that the Darkness has now been
            released into the world, something Dean tried to avoid. Dean and his
            brother soon met God who returned to help put an end to the danger
            to the world. During this time, Dean got through to God about not
            sacrificing himself and The Darkness about not destroying all of
            reality and helped them reconcile. As a reward, Dean was given back
            his mother and was able to return to his usual style of hunting with
            his family.

            With his mother trapped in an alternate reality, Dean set out with
            Sam, Castiel and the Nephilim Jack to rescue Mary and reunite his
            family, a situation made more urgent by the upcoming invasion of an
            alternate reality Michael. Following the reunion of his family, Dean
            agreed to become the vessel for the alternate Michael in order to
            finish Lucifer once and for all. Aided by Michael, Dean faced
            Lucifer in battle and ultimately killed the rogue archangel and
            ended his long reign of terror. This victory was short-lived as Dean
            was to be betrayed by Michael who took full control of Dean and
            became loose upon the Main Universe in Dean's body, his one true
            vessel. Michael would use him for weeks before he left Dean's body
            on his own for unknown reasons.

            In the days after, Dean struggled with re-adjusting to being himself
            again as he tried to help Sam on hunts. However, he regain his will
            and did better in hunting, as he and his family decided to go after
            Michael and defeat him. Dean also bonded with Jack after learning
            his declining health. During a confrontation with Michael, the
            Archangel retook control of Dean after revealing that he left to
            break his spirits and locked the hunter away in his subconscious.
            However, Dean manages to trap Michael within his own subconscious
            shortly thereafter, but is left worried for what will occur if the
            archangel escapes.

            Following a hunt, Dean lost concentration over keeping Michael
            imprisoned but the latter instead escaped Dean's mind and took
            Rowena for an alternative vessel while inflicting revenge on Dean.
            However, Michael was then killed by Jack, saving the world from his
            influence and freeing Dean of his grasp.

            Almost five years after defeating God himself, Dean is killed for a
            final time during the Masked Vampires hunt. Dean accepts his fate
            and his soul goes to Heaven where he is reunited with Bobby Singer
            and later Sam who lived out a full life with a son that he names in
            honor of Dean.
